## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

This open-source project offers a free alternative to Linktree. It's designed to help you aggregate and showcase your social media profiles and other important links efficiently. 

Special thanks to [John Emerson](https://github.com/johnggli) for the inspiration and contributions to this project.
